    "\n",
    "In the frequentist approach, probability is a limiting frequency. Thus,\n",
    "probabilities are always associated with random events. In Bayesian\n",
    "inference, on the other hand, probability is used to quantify your\n",
    "belief that an unobservable variable has a particular value. For example\n",
    "a Bayesian can ask questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   What is the probability that heritability for milk yield is larger\n",
    "    than 0.5?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   What is the probability that variability in milk yield is due to\n",
    "    more than 100 loci?\n",
    "\n",
    "These Bayesian probabilities are not necessarily associated with a\n",
    "random experiment that assigns values to the variables in question.\n",

    "-   Bayesian inference starts by specifying what you believe about the\n",
    "    parameters or unknowns through prior probabilities. In whole-genome\n",
    "    analyses, we will use a prior probability density to quantify our\n",
    "    belief that the effect of most marker covariates is zero or close to\n",
    "    zero and only a few covariates have effects that deviate from zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   These parameters are related to the data through the model or\n",
    "    “likelihood”, which are conditional probabilities for the data given\n",
    "    the parameters. In whole-genome analyses, this is usually a multiple\n",
    "    regression model with normally distributed residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The prior and the likelihood are combined using Bayes theorem to\n",
    "    obtain posterior probabilities, which are conditional probabilities\n",
